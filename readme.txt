Welcome to Epithets! The very cool awesome visual novel I'm hoping to complete... eventually.
The story centers on five Japanese students studying in San Francisco when a weird conspiracy
begins to haunt their club.

There are five main routes:
- Fuyuhiko (Alone): I want this to focus on Fuyuhiko's relationship with his work and feeling
infantilized as a result of his disability. This exists as a subplot in all routes but is focused
on when Fuyuhiko doesn't interact with the club.
- Himiko: The chaotic riot grrrl herself, she doesn't actually technically attend the college that
the rest of the club does. Her brother does though, and no one ever seems to stop her from showing
up. Her route focuses on her and Fuyuhiko's frustration with the world and capitalism, and that affects
how they deal with the rising tensions.
- Yoikishi: The himbo with a heart of gold, Yoikishi is true golden retriever energy, as much I hated
writing that. His name is remnant of his origins as a BNHA OC, we should consider changing it to Ryuji
like most modern incarnations of him. His route focuses on him teaching Fuyuhiko to take it easy sometimes
and see the good side of life. That optimism affects how they ultimately see the actions of their friends,
quite the opposite of his sister.
- Rei: The potentially problematic mockery of cult-like faith. Rei is steeped in the control of the cult
his family swears alligance to. Although, the god that supposedly watches all their actions and that for
which Rei is meant to hold a major role for may be more than fiction. His route with Fuyuhiko sees them
trying to break free of forces that may or may not be ultimately beyond their control.
- Haruki: The massive goddamned flirt. Haruki has a boy problem, one that has stark white hair and an
attitude problem. Fuyuhiko can't handle the fact that someone could possibly care about him, especially
him in specific. It feels almost patronizing, how dare Haruki adore him. Their route centers on Fuyuhiko
learning to accept affection, while still maintaining his boundaries in the face of objective danger 
mind you.
